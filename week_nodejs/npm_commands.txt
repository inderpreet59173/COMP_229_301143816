->for package.json (setting up node server on localhost):
go to index.js
go to terminal->new terminal, then type
npm init
provide description like first node demo
provide author as 301143816



to run the server, type in terminal
node index.js
go to browser, type localhost:3000

to stop server (needed when we change something in code):
press Ctrl+C
then restart by typing
node index.js

we use nodemon (3rd party package) to prevent restarting the server again and again after every change.
to install type in terminal
npm install -g nodemon

if it doesn't update the package, try 
npm install

nodemon didn't get added to package.json, might be an exception

now type in terminal
nodemon
it will start server and then make any changes to index.js and save it and there is no need to restart the server.
